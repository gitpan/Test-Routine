0.013     2011-09-08 16:46:01 America/New_York

          MooseX::Method::Signatures is not a prereq, it's optionally used in
          some tests; the dist prereqs have been corrected to reflect this

          We now forbid two tests with the same name.  This may seem to be
          backwards incompatible, but the previous behavior was to silently
          replace each test in turn, so that tests written would simply not
          run.  To allow safer routine composition, we have made duplicate
          names fatal, rather than adding arbitrary distinguishing suffixes.
