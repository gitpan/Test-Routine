#pod     # This block defines the HashTester package.  It's a Test::Routine, meaning
#pod     # it's a role.  We define state that the test will need to keep and any
#pod     # requirements we might have.
#pod     #
#pod     # Before we can run this test, we'll need to compose the role into a class so
#pod     # that we can make an instance.
#pod     package HashTester;
#pod     use Test::Routine;
#pod   
#pod     # We import stuff from Test::More because, well, who wants to re-write all
#pod     # those really useful test routines that exist out there?  Maybe somebody,
#pod     # but not me.
#pod     use Test::More;
#pod   
#pod     # ...but then we use namespace::autoclean to get rid of the routines once
#pod     # we've bound to them.  This is just standard Moose practice, anyway, right?
#pod     use namespace::autoclean;
#pod   
#pod     # Finally, some state!  Every test will get called as method on an instance,
#pod     # and it will have this attribute.  Here are some points of interest:
#pod     #
#pod     # - We're giving this attribute a builder, so it will try to get built with a
#pod     #   call to $self->build_hash_to_test -- so each class that composes this
#pod     #   role can provide means for these attributes (fixtures) to be generated as
#pod     #   needed.
#pod     #
#pod     # - We are not adding "requires 'build_hash_to_test'", because then we can
#pod     #   apply this role to Moose::Object and instantiate it with a given value
#pod     #   in the constructor.  There will be an example of this below.  This lets
#pod     #   us re-use these tests in many variations without having to write class
#pod     #   after class.
#pod     #
#pod     # - We don't use lazy_build because it would create a clearer.  If someone
#pod     #   then cleared our lazy_build fixture, it could not be re-built in the
#pod     #   event that we'd gotten it explicitly from the constructor!
#pod     #
#pod     # Using Moose attributes for our state and fixtures allows us to get all of
#pod     # their powerful behaviors like types, delegation, traits, and so on, and
#pod     # allows us to decompose shared behavior into roles.
#pod     #
#pod     has hash_to_test => (
#pod       is  => 'ro',
#pod       isa => 'HashRef',
#pod       builder => 'build_hash_to_test',
#pod     );
#pod   
#pod     # Here, we're just declaring an actual test that we will run.  This sub will
#pod     # get installed as a method with a name that won't get clobbered easily.  The
#pod     # method will be found later by run_tests so we can find and execute all
#pod     # tests on an instance.
#pod     #
#pod     # There is nothing magical about this method!  Calling this method is
#pod     # performed in a Test::More subtest block.  A TAP plan can be issued with
#pod     # "plan", and we can issue TODO or SKIP directives the same way.  There is
#pod     # none of the return-to-skip magic that we find in Test::Class.
#pod     #
#pod     # The string after "test" is used as the method name -- which means we're
#pod     # getting a method name with spaces in it.  This can be slightly problematic
#pod     # if you try to use, say, ::, in a method name.  For the most part, it works
#pod     # quite well -- but look at the next test for an example of how to give an
#pod     # explicit description.

#pod     };
#pod   
#pod     # The only thing of note here is that we're passing a hashref of extra args
#pod     # to the test method constructor.  "desc" lets us set the test's description,
#pod     # which is used in the test output, so we can avoid weird method names being
#pod     # installed.  Also note that we order tests more or less by order of
#pod     # definition, not by name or description.

#pod   # We use Test::More to get done_testing.  We don't assume that run_tests is the
#pod   # entire test, because that way we can (as we do here) run multiple test
#pod   # instances, and can intersperse other kinds of sanity checks amongst the
#pod   # Test::Routine-style tests.
#pod   use Test::More;

#pod   run_tests('ProcessHash obj' => ProcessHash->new({ hash_to_test => { 1 => 0 }}));

#pod   # We could also just supply a class name and a set of args to pass to new.
#pod   # The below is very nearly equivalent to the above:
#pod   run_tests('ProcessHash new' => ProcessHash => { hash_to_test => { 1 => 0 }});
#pod   
#pod   # ...and here, the second arg is not a class or instance at all, but the
#pod   # Test::Routine role (by name).  Since we know we can't instantiate a role,
#pod   # run_tests will try to compose it with Moose::Object.  Then the args are used
#pod   # as the args to ->new on the new class, as above.  This lets us write
#pod   # Test::Routines that can be tested with the right state to start with, or
#pod   # Test::Routines that need to be composed with testing fixture classes.

#pod   # Welcome to part two of the Test::Routine demo.  This is showing how you can
#pod   # write quick one-off tests without having to write a bunch of .pm files or
#pod   # (worse?) embed packages in bare blocks in the odious way that 01-demo.t did.
#pod   #
#pod   # First off, we use Test::Routine.  As it did before, this turns the current
#pod   # package (main!) into a Test::Routine role.  It also has the pleasant
#pod   # side-effect of turning on strict and warnings.
#pod   use Test::Routine;
#pod   
#pod   # Then we bring in the utils, because we'll want to run_tests later.
#pod   use Test::Routine::Util;
#pod   
#pod   # And, finally, we bring in Test::More so that we can use test assertions, and
#pod   # namespace::autoclean to clean up after us.
#pod   use Test::More;
#pod   use namespace::autoclean;
#pod   
#pod   # We're going to give our tests some state.  It's nothing special.
#pod   has counter => (
#pod     is  => 'rw',
#pod     isa => 'Int',
#pod     default => 0,
#pod   );
#pod   
#pod   # Then another boring but useful hunk of code: a method for our test routine.
#pod   sub counter_is_even {
#pod     my ($self) = @_;
#pod     return $self->counter % 2 == 0;
#pod   }
#pod   
#pod   # Then we can write some tests, just like we did before.  Here, we're writing
#pod   # several tests, and they will be run in the order in which they were defined.
#pod   # You can see that they rely on the state being maintained.
#pod   test 'start even' => sub {
#pod     my ($self) = @_;
#pod     ok($self->counter_is_even, "we start with an even counter");
#pod   
#pod     $self->counter( $self->counter + 1);
#pod   };
#pod   
#pod   test 'terminate odd' => sub {
#pod     my ($self) = @_;
#pod   
#pod     ok(! $self->counter_is_even, "the counter is odd, so state was preserved");
#pod     pass("for your information, the counter is " . $self->counter);
#pod   };
#pod   
#pod   # Now we can run these tests just by saying "run_me" -- rather than expecting a
#pod   # class or role name, it uses the caller.  In this case, the calling package
#pod   # (main!) is a Test::Routine, so the runner composes it with Moose::Object,
#pod   # instantiating it, and running the tests on the instance.
#pod   run_me;
#pod   
#pod   # Since each test run gets its own instance, we can run the test suite again,
#pod   # possibly to verify that the test suite is not destructive of some external
#pod   # state.
#pod   run_me("second run");
#pod   
#pod   # And we can pass in args to use when constructing the object to be tested.
#pod   # Given the tests above, we can pick any starting value for "counter" that is
#pod   # even.
#pod   run_me({ counter => 192 });
#pod   
#pod   # ...and we're done!
#pod   done_testing;

#pod   # each test.  With Test::Routine, we assume that you will do most of this sort
#pod   # of thing in your BUILD, DEMOLISH, and attribute management.  Still, you can
#pod   # easily do setup and teardown by applying method modifiers to the "run_test"
#pod   # method, which your Test::Routine uses to run each test.  Here's a simple
#pod   # example.
#pod   
#pod   # We have the same boring state that we saw before.  It's just an integer that
#pod   # is carried over between tests.
#pod   has counter => (
#pod     is   => 'rw',
#pod     isa  => 'Int',
#pod     lazy => 1,
#pod     default => 0,
#pod     clearer => 'clear_counter',
#pod   );
#pod   
#pod   # The first test changes the counter's value and leaves it changed.
#pod   test test_0 => sub {
#pod     my ($self) = @_;
#pod   
#pod     is($self->counter, 0, 'start with counter = 0');
#pod     $self->counter( $self->counter + 1);
#pod     is($self->counter, 1, 'end with counter = 1');
#pod   };
#pod   
#pod   # The second test assumes that the value is the default, again.  We want to
#pod   # make sure that before each test, the counter is reset, but we don't want to
#pod   # tear down and recreate the whole object, because it may have other, more
#pod   # expensive resources built.
#pod   test test_1 => sub {
#pod     my ($self) = @_;
#pod   
#pod     is($self->counter, 0, 'counter is reset between tests');
#pod   };
#pod   
#pod   # ...so we apply a "before" modifier to each test run, calling the clearer on
#pod   # the counter.  When next accessed, it will re-initialize to zero.  We could
#pod   # call any other code we want here, and we can compose numerous modifiers
#pod   # together onto run_test.

#pod   # If you want to clear *all* the object state between each test... you probably

  # write quick one-off tests without having to write a bunch of .pm files or
  # (worse?) embed packages in bare blocks in the odious way that 01-demo.t did.
  #
  # First off, we use Test::Routine.  As it did before, this turns the current
  # package (main!) into a Test::Routine role.  It also has the pleasant
  # side-effect of turning on strict and warnings.
  use Test::Routine;
  
  # Then we bring in the utils, because we'll want to run_tests later.
  use Test::Routine::Util;
  
  # And, finally, we bring in Test::More so that we can use test assertions, and
  # namespace::autoclean to clean up after us.

  use namespace::autoclean;
  
  # We're going to give our tests some state.  It's nothing special.

    default => 0,

  # Then another boring but useful hunk of code: a method for our test routine.
  sub counter_is_even {
    my ($self) = @_;
    return $self->counter % 2 == 0;
  }
  
  # Then we can write some tests, just like we did before.  Here, we're writing
  # several tests, and they will be run in the order in which they were defined.
  # You can see that they rely on the state being maintained.
  test 'start even' => sub {
    my ($self) = @_;
    ok($self->counter_is_even, "we start with an even counter");
  
    $self->counter( $self->counter + 1);
  };
  
  test 'terminate odd' => sub {
    my ($self) = @_;
  
    ok(! $self->counter_is_even, "the counter is odd, so state was preserved");
    pass("for your information, the counter is " . $self->counter);
  };
  
  # Now we can run these tests just by saying "run_me" -- rather than expecting a
  # class or role name, it uses the caller.  In this case, the calling package
  # (main!) is a Test::Routine, so the runner composes it with Moose::Object,
  # instantiating it, and running the tests on the instance.

  # Since each test run gets its own instance, we can run the test suite again,
  # possibly to verify that the test suite is not destructive of some external
  # state.

  # easily do setup and teardown by applying method modifiers to the "run_test"
  # method, which your Test::Routine uses to run each test.  Here's a simple
  # example.

  # the counter.  When next accessed, it will re-initialize to zero.  We could
  # call any other code we want here, and we can compose numerous modifiers
