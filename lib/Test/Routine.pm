#pod =head1 DESCRIPTION
#pod
#pod Test::Routine is a very simple framework for writing your tests as composable
#pod units of assertion.  In other words: roles.
#pod
#pod For a walkthrough of tests written with Test::Routine, see
#pod L<Test::Routine::Manual::Demo>.
#pod
#pod Test::Routine is similar to L<Test::Class> in some ways.  These similarities
#pod are largely superficial, but the idea of "tests bound together in reusable
#pod units" is a useful one to understand when coming to Test::Routine.  If you are
#pod already familiar with Test::Class, it is the differences rather than the
#pod similarities that will be more important to understand.  If you are not
#pod familiar with Test::Class, there is no need to understand it prior to using
#pod Test::Routine.
#pod
#pod On the other hand, an understanding of the basics of L<Moose> is absolutely
#pod essential.  Test::Routine composes tests from Moose classes, roles, and
#pod attributes.  Without an understanding of those, you will not be able to use
#pod Test::Routine.  The L<Moose::Manual> is an excellent resource for learning
#pod Moose, and has links to other online tutorials and documentation.
#pod
#pod =head2 The Concepts
#pod
#pod =head2 The Basics of Using Test::Routine
#pod
#pod There actually isn't much to Test::Routine I<other> than the basics.  It does
#pod not provide many complex features, instead delegating almost everything to the
#pod Moose object system.
#pod
#pod =head3 Writing Tests
#pod
#pod To write a set of tests (a test routine, which is a role), you add C<use
#pod Test::Routine;> to your package.  C<main> is an acceptable target for turning
#pod into a test routine, meaning that you may use Test::Routine in your F<*.t>
#pod files in your distribution.
#pod
#pod C<use>-ing Test::Routine will turn your package into a role that composes
#pod L<Test::Routine::Common>, and will give you the C<test> declarator for adding
#pod tests to your routine.  Test::Routine::Common adds the C<run_test> method that
#pod will be called to run each test.
#pod
#pod The C<test> declarator is very simple, and will generally be called like this:
#pod
#pod   test $NAME_OF_TEST => sub {
#pod     my ($self) = @_;
#pod
#pod     is($self->foo, 123, "we got the foo we expected");
#pod     ...
#pod     ...
#pod   };
#pod
#pod This defines a test with a given name, which will be invoked like a method on
#pod the test object (described below).  Tests are ordered by declaration within the
#pod file, but when multiple test routines are run in a single test, the ordering of
#pod the routines is B<undefined>.
#pod
#pod C<test> may also be given a different name for the installed method and the
#pod test description.  This isn't usually needed, but can make things clearer when
#pod referring to tests as methods:
#pod
#pod   test $NAME_OF_TEST_METHOD => { description => $TEST_DESCRIPTION } => sub {
#pod     ...
#pod   }
#pod
#pod Each test will be run by the C<run_test> method.  To add setup or teardown
#pod behavior, advice (method modifiers) may be attached to that method.  For
#pod example, to call an attribute clearer before each test, you could add:
#pod
#pod   before run_test => sub {
#pod     my ($self) = @_;
#pod
#pod     $self->clear_some_attribute;
#pod   };
#pod
#pod =head3 Running Tests
#pod
#pod To run tests, you will need to use L<Test::Routine::Util>, which will provide
#pod two functions for running tests: C<run_tests> and C<run_me>.  The former is
#pod given a set of packages to compose and run as tests.  The latter runs the
#pod caller, assuming it to be a test routine.
#pod
#pod C<run_tests> can be called in several ways:
#pod
#pod   run_tests( $desc, $object );
#pod
#pod   run_tests( $desc, \@packages, $arg );
#pod
#pod   run_tests( $desc, $package, $arg );  # equivalent to ($desc, [$pkg], $arg)
#pod
#pod In the first case, the object is assumed to be a fully formed, testable object.
#pod In other words, you have already created a class that composes test routines
#pod and have built an instance of it.
#pod
#pod In the other cases, C<run_tests> will produce an instance for you.  It divides
#pod the given packages into classes and roles.  If more than one class was given,
#pod an exception is thrown.  A new class is created subclassing the given class and
#pod applying the given roles.  If no class was in the list, Moose::Object is used.
#pod The new class's C<new> is called with the given C<$arg> (if any).
#pod
#pod The composition mechanism makes it easy to run a test routine without first
#pod writing a class to which to apply it.  This is what makes it possible to write
#pod your test routine in the C<main> package and run it directly from your F<*.t>
#pod file.  The following is a valid, trivial use of Test::Routine:
#pod
#pod   use Test::More;
#pod   use Test::Routine;
#pod   use Test::Routine::Util;
#pod
#pod   test demo_test => sub { pass("everything is okay") };
#pod
#pod   run_tests('our tests', 'main');
#pod   done_testing;
#pod
#pod In this circumstance, though, you'd probably use C<run_me>, which runs the
#pod tests in the caller.  You'd just replace the C<run_tests> line with
#pod C<< run_me; >>.  A description for the run may be supplied, if you like.
#pod
#pod Each call to C<run_me> or C<run_tests> generates a new instance, and you can
#pod call them as many times, with as many different arguments, as you like.  Since
#pod Test::Routine can't know how many times you'll call different test routines,
#pod you are responsible for calling C<L<done_testing|Test::More/done_testing>> when
#pod you're done testing.
#pod
#pod =head4 Running individual tests
#pod
#pod If you only want to run a subset of the tests, you can set the
#pod C<TEST_METHOD> environment variable to a regular expression that matches
#pod the names of the tests you want to run.
#pod
#pod For example, to run just the test named C<customer profile> in the
#pod C<MyTests> class.
#pod
#pod   use Test::More;
#pod   use Test::Routine::Util;
#pod
#pod   $ENV{TEST_METHOD} = 'customer profile';
#pod   run_tests('one test', 'MyTests');
#pod   done_testing;
#pod
#pod To run all tests with C<customer> in the name:
#pod
#pod   use Test::More;
#pod   use Test::Routine::Util;
#pod
#pod   $ENV{TEST_METHOD}= '.*customer.*';
#pod   run_tests('some tests', 'MyTests');
#pod   done_testing;
#pod
#pod If you specify an invalid regular expression, your tests will not be
#pod run:
#pod
#pod   use Test::More;
#pod   use Test::Routine::Util
#pod
#pod   $ENV{TEST_METHOD} = 'C++'
#pod   run_tests('invalid', 'MyTests');
#pod   done_testing;
#pod
#pod When you run it:
#pod
#pod       1..0
#pod       # No tests run!
#pod   not ok 1 - No tests run for subtest "invalid"

=head1 DESCRIPTION

Test::Routine is a very simple framework for writing your tests as composable
units of assertion.  In other words: roles.

For a walkthrough of tests written with Test::Routine, see
L<Test::Routine::Manual::Demo>.

Test::Routine is similar to L<Test::Class> in some ways.  These similarities
are largely superficial, but the idea of "tests bound together in reusable
units" is a useful one to understand when coming to Test::Routine.  If you are
already familiar with Test::Class, it is the differences rather than the
similarities that will be more important to understand.  If you are not
familiar with Test::Class, there is no need to understand it prior to using
Test::Routine.

On the other hand, an understanding of the basics of L<Moose> is absolutely
essential.  Test::Routine composes tests from Moose classes, roles, and
attributes.  Without an understanding of those, you will not be able to use
Test::Routine.  The L<Moose::Manual> is an excellent resource for learning
Moose, and has links to other online tutorials and documentation.

=head2 The Concepts

=head2 The Basics of Using Test::Routine

There actually isn't much to Test::Routine I<other> than the basics.  It does
not provide many complex features, instead delegating almost everything to the
Moose object system.

=head3 Writing Tests

To write a set of tests (a test routine, which is a role), you add C<use
Test::Routine;> to your package.  C<main> is an acceptable target for turning
into a test routine, meaning that you may use Test::Routine in your F<*.t>
files in your distribution.

C<use>-ing Test::Routine will turn your package into a role that composes
L<Test::Routine::Common>, and will give you the C<test> declarator for adding
tests to your routine.  Test::Routine::Common adds the C<run_test> method that
will be called to run each test.

The C<test> declarator is very simple, and will generally be called like this:

  test $NAME_OF_TEST => sub {
    my ($self) = @_;

    is($self->foo, 123, "we got the foo we expected");
    ...
    ...
  };

This defines a test with a given name, which will be invoked like a method on
the test object (described below).  Tests are ordered by declaration within the
file, but when multiple test routines are run in a single test, the ordering of
the routines is B<undefined>.

C<test> may also be given a different name for the installed method and the
test description.  This isn't usually needed, but can make things clearer when
referring to tests as methods:

  test $NAME_OF_TEST_METHOD => { description => $TEST_DESCRIPTION } => sub {
    ...
  }

Each test will be run by the C<run_test> method.  To add setup or teardown
behavior, advice (method modifiers) may be attached to that method.  For
example, to call an attribute clearer before each test, you could add:

  before run_test => sub {
    my ($self) = @_;

    $self->clear_some_attribute;
  };

=head3 Running Tests

To run tests, you will need to use L<Test::Routine::Util>, which will provide
two functions for running tests: C<run_tests> and C<run_me>.  The former is
given a set of packages to compose and run as tests.  The latter runs the
caller, assuming it to be a test routine.

C<run_tests> can be called in several ways:

  run_tests( $desc, $object );

  run_tests( $desc, \@packages, $arg );

  run_tests( $desc, $package, $arg );  # equivalent to ($desc, [$pkg], $arg)

In the first case, the object is assumed to be a fully formed, testable object.
In other words, you have already created a class that composes test routines
and have built an instance of it.

In the other cases, C<run_tests> will produce an instance for you.  It divides
the given packages into classes and roles.  If more than one class was given,
an exception is thrown.  A new class is created subclassing the given class and
applying the given roles.  If no class was in the list, Moose::Object is used.
The new class's C<new> is called with the given C<$arg> (if any).

The composition mechanism makes it easy to run a test routine without first
writing a class to which to apply it.  This is what makes it possible to write
your test routine in the C<main> package and run it directly from your F<*.t>
file.  The following is a valid, trivial use of Test::Routine:

  use Test::More;
  use Test::Routine;
  use Test::Routine::Util;

  test demo_test => sub { pass("everything is okay") };

  run_tests('our tests', 'main');
  done_testing;

In this circumstance, though, you'd probably use C<run_me>, which runs the
tests in the caller.  You'd just replace the C<run_tests> line with
C<< run_me; >>.  A description for the run may be supplied, if you like.

Each call to C<run_me> or C<run_tests> generates a new instance, and you can
call them as many times, with as many different arguments, as you like.  Since
Test::Routine can't know how many times you'll call different test routines,
you are responsible for calling C<L<done_testing|Test::More/done_testing>> when
you're done testing.

=head4 Running individual tests

If you only want to run a subset of the tests, you can set the
C<TEST_METHOD> environment variable to a regular expression that matches
the names of the tests you want to run.

For example, to run just the test named C<customer profile> in the
C<MyTests> class.

  use Test::More;
  use Test::Routine::Util;

  $ENV{TEST_METHOD} = 'customer profile';
  run_tests('one test', 'MyTests');
  done_testing;

To run all tests with C<customer> in the name:

  use Test::More;
  use Test::Routine::Util;

  $ENV{TEST_METHOD}= '.*customer.*';
  run_tests('some tests', 'MyTests');
  done_testing;

If you specify an invalid regular expression, your tests will not be
run:

  use Test::More;
  use Test::Routine::Util

  $ENV{TEST_METHOD} = 'C++'
  run_tests('invalid', 'MyTests');
  done_testing;

When you run it:

      1..0
      # No tests run!
  not ok 1 - No tests run for subtest "invalid"
